## 📂 Description
The Unsupervised Models course was an essential journey to deepen the understanding and application of advanced Data Science and Machine Learning techniques in a professional context.

Unsupervised learning stands out as an area of great interest and investment in the industry, as it allows data models to identify hidden patterns and relationships without the need for prior categorization by humans—a process that is often costly and time-consuming. Mastering these techniques opens doors to innovations in areas such as fraud detection, audience segmentation, and industrial process optimization.

In this course, it was possible to explore the fundamental distinction between unsupervised learning and other Machine Learning models. The KMeans algorithm was one of the tools covered to identify natural clusters in datasets. Additionally, Mixture Models and Gaussian Mixture Models were explored, sophisticated models capable of handling the uncertainty inherent in real-world data, with applications in anomaly detection and fraud.

By combining robust theory with practical exercises, the course provided a solid foundation for confidently applying unsupervised learning techniques to real-world problems.

## 📊 Projects

### 🏫 Clustering and Segmentation of American Universities

In this project, the KMeans Clustering method was used to segment universities in the United States into public and private, considering various indicators. The data analyzed includes the number of students, expenditure per student, and graduation rate.
